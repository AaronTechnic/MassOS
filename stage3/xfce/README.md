# Xfce build system Stage 3 files
Xfce is the original desktop environment MassOS which is fully supported.

The files in this directory are the Stage 3 files for the MassOS build system.

Xfce also serves as the reference implementation of a MassOS Stage 3 port.

At the present time, Xfce is the only desktop environment which has its Stage 3 files in the main MassOS repository. Other officially supported desktop environments such as [GNOME](https://github.com/MassOS-Linux/MassOS-GNOME) may be in other repositories available from the [MassOS-Linux](https://github.com/MassOS-Linux) GitHub organization, and/or may be submoduled in the `stage3` directory of the MassOS repository.

Please see the `README` file in the `stage3` directory of the MassOS repository for more information about Stage 3 in the MassOS build system.
